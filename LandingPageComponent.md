# Code Extraction from Editor

## Summary
The code editor is displaying the content of the file `App.tsx` from a web-based development environment (likely a remix or app editor). The visible code snippet is the beginning of a React component, including a license comment and the default export of the `App` function. The code appears incomplete in the current view, showing only the function declaration and a basic return statement with an empty `<div>`. No errors or additional context are visible in the editor pane.

## Extracted Code Content
The following is the exact code visible in the code editor:

```tsx
/**
 * @license
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 */
export default function App return
<div></div>;
```

### Notes on Extraction
- The code seems truncated or partially rendered in the screenshot (e.g., missing closing braces or full structure).
- File context: This is from `src/App.tsx` in the project structure.
- No other code files are open or visible in the editor; the file explorer shows related files like `index.html`, `package.json`, etc., but they are not expanded.

## Source
Web page from a code editing platform (e.g., remix/app editor interface), file: `App.tsx`. Based on screenshot and provided textual content.
